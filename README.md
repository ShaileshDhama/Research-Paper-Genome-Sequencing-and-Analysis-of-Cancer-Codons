### Description

Genome Sequencing in the field of Bioinformatics is quite an evolving application as all the information of an organism is carried on its DNA.

Sequencing and Analysis of genome helps in rapid clinical diagnosis and treatment of diseases and advanced scientific research.

In this paper, We increase the efficiency of finding mutations with primary techniques namely, indexing, pattern matching, sequence alignments and comparison of FASTA files to find out variation, leading to the increase in accuracy of finding cancer genome mutation.
